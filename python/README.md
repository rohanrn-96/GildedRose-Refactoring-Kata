# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata (Python)

This repository contains a refactored version of the Gilded Rose kata,
focused on safe refactoring, extensible design, and test-driven validation.

The original legacy tooling (TextTest, ApprovalTests) has been preserved,
while modern pytest-based unit tests are used as the primary verification
mechanism.
